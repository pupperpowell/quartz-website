Our digital landscape is chronological (if not algorithmic). Your Instagram posts are arranged by date posted. Your Facebook feed is roughly ordered by recency. Your most important emails are inevitably forced down a long, long list by newer, less important ones.

But writing as a form of art and expression is nonlinear, a nearly endless cycle of drafting, editing, putting away some things and dusting off others. So why do we display our writing online in neat little rows? Why do we hoard our words and publish them once?

A while ago, somebody asked me if I'd been writing publicly. They "wanted a way to keep up with my life," and I was so surprised and pleased to be asked this that I immediately decided to start writing again. It is a blessing to have so many writers around me that I want to emulate; from Jarod's unashamed zeal to Cat's authenticity, [Tiramisu's](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev) discipline, [Elaine's](https://lainesmeow.substack.com/) persistence, and many others, all of whom I will be shamelessly copying as best I can.

One of my favorite sources of inspiration is [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com). She is a designer/engineer by profession, but writes about the intersection of sociology and technology. Her essays are delightful, but one habit I will be stealing from her is how she organizes her writing. Visit her page and look around for yourself, then come back, and I will tell you more.

Her writings are not pieces of paper stored in folders locked away in a digital filing cabinet. They are "plants", organized by stage of growth. They are alive. No chronological lists are to be found on her website. Her essays and notes are not "posted", they are "planted"; they are not "edited", but "tended". All together they make up what is called a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Such a small change in how things are called has a really big impact in how we understand reading and writing. 

## What is digital gardening?
Most people only read a book once. Why should they reread it? Maybe they read it a long time ago, and want to remember it. Maybe they are looking for things they missed the first time. Maybe they want to understand the book better. But thankfully, the book is finished. It will never change. So reading a book once is usually enough.

But when we imagine pieces of writing as plants, it unlocks a new way of thinking. A plant is expected to grow over time, but you don't stand there watching it. Tiny, incremental changes add up to a delightful surprise when you look at it a month later and notice how big and strong it has grown. An essay in a digital garden is edited constantly, and changes each time you visit it.

It's been difficult to adjust to this mindset when wandering through [other](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) [people's](https://jzhao.xyz/) [digital](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) [gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners?tab=readme-ov-file#digital-garden-directory). My brain is still stuck in social media land, and I want to see every update to every piece of writing that my favorite authors publish. Trying to do that is missing the point, though. It took actually gardening—as in, writing more frequently—to get a better feel for the digital gardening mindset.

In ancient times, books were written on reeds or parchment. Some time passed and we invented the printing press. You could write something and make a gazillion copies of it and a lot of people would see it. But once it was out, there was no taking it back. Like many other things, we continued that paradigm in the technological age: You write something, put it out there for everyone to see, slap the date next to the title, and call it a day.

But when we think of pieces of writing like plants instead of like artifacts, we have a different understanding; your writing can grow over time. This better aligns with how most famous authors actually write:

> “When you read a book or a screenplay and think, ‘Wow, I could never do this.’ Well, don’t forget: that person didn’t start with that. They started with shit—that they fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed and fixed.”
> —Peter Farrelly

The most valuable thing I have cultivated since adopting this ethos is a better relationship with writing. Writing online has a connotation with the pursuit for money and fame. As someone who occasionally wants money and fame, it has been hard to separate those questionable desires from writing. At its core, this approach relies on others to decide if your writing has value. But growing a garden will never make you famous or wealthy. You do it for simple fruits and vegetables. The fruit of writing is a work you can be proud of, even when nobody sees it but you.

I will plant seeds on this website, but they will never be finished. They will grow, get watered, and get pruned. If I take care of them, they will grow into something beautiful.
